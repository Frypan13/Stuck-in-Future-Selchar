Stuck-in-Future-Selchar
=======================

I was doing the Craftmas Chaos quest on Wynncraft. I had defeated the Dark Relicstone and been teleported to Future Selchar. As I found the cave where I needed to go to meet the survivor, it kicked me out saying that "the air is to thick, better stay away." I tried a couple more times, thinking that it might be a glitch, but to no avail. Then I checked my inventory to see if something in it might be stopping me and I realized that I didn't have the Corrupting Relic Shard. Now I'm stuck in Future Selchar and I can't continue the quest.
